We would never want you to be any other way\". And with that, Cotton\\'s mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton\\'s fur was all all dry. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t ever do that again, Cotton!\" they all cried. \"Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn\\'t want that!\" \\n\\nThen Cotton thought, \"I change my mind.
